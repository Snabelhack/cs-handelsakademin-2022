#region Design

// 01. Specify all the services (methods) you think a class Chronometer should have

// 02. Specify all the services (methods) you think a class PhoneBook should have

// 03. Specify all the services (methods) you think a class BankAccount should have

// 04. Specify all the services (methods) you think a class Date should have

// 05. Specify all the services (methods) you think a class Hour should have

// 06. Suppose you need to implement an application to perform math computations
// (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and percent).
// Which kind of object would you use to achieve this goal?
// Specify all the services (methods) you think such a type (class) should have

#region Implementation

// 07. Implement the Chronometer you designed in exercise 01
// 08. Implement the PhoneBook you designed in exercise 02
// 09. Implement the BankAccount you designed in exercise 03
// 10. Implement the Date you designed in exercise 04
// 11. Implement the Hour you designed in exercise 05
// 12. Implement the type you designed in exercise 06

#region Usage

// 13. Implement a console application where you ask the user to input his name.
//     Once the user have done that, show the time in milliseconds he spent
// Example:
// What is your name? Kalle Anka
// Hi Kalle Anka, you spent 4355 milliseconds to write your name

// 14. Implement a console application allowing the user to interact with the PhoneBook
//     you implemented in exercise 08. For example, you application might allow the user
//     to store up to 10 (name, phoneNumber) pairs (depending on what you have designed).
//     The user could store a new pair ("Greta Gris", 07612345678), search the phone of
//     a given person, etc. It is ALL UP TO YOU to decide how your application will work.

// 15. Exactly like in the exercise 14, implement a console application allowing the
//     user to interact with the BankAccount implemented in exercise 09

1. Design a hierarchy allowing the evaluation of arithmetic expressions
(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). Use the decimal
type to represent numbers. Notice that expressions are formed by
operands and operators. There is not limit of the amount of operations
that can be represented.
2 + 4 * 2 - 8 * (3 - 4 / 2)

[Hint: You might find some inspiration in the circuits hierarchy]

2. Add to the hierarchy support for square root.

Add the class Triangle to the Figure hierarchy. A triangle can be defined by the
lengths of their sides. Notice that not every triad of lengths form a triangle. E.g
(3, 10, 4).
Which condition must meet 3 lengths in order to form a triangle?
Make sure to enforce this constraint in the constructor of the class.
